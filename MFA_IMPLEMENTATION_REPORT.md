# MFA Implementation Progress Report

## Completed Work

1. **User MFA Configuration**
   - Set up MFA for test user
   - Added TOTP secret generation and storage
   - Configured database to store MFA settings

2. **MFA Challenge Flow**
   - Modified login handler to challenge MFA-enabled users
   - Created MFA verification endpoint
   - Implemented TOTP verification
   - Successfully tested manual MFA verification

3. **Security Improvements**
   - Fixed refresh token uniqueness issue
   - Added session ID generation for MFA challenges
   - Implemented proper token management
   - Added audit logging for MFA events

## Issues Encountered & Solutions

1. **Session ID Not Included in Response**
   - Issue: Login handler was returning only the MFA challenge message
   - Solution: Modified login response to include session_id and user_id

2. **MFA Verification Process**
   - Issue: The verify-mfa endpoint required exact session ID format
   - Solution: Implemented manual session ID generation and verification

3. **TestSprite Compatibility**
   - Issue: TestSprite was expecting different API responses
   - Solution: Modified the compatibility endpoints to handle MFA flow

## Next Steps

1. **Complete TestSprite Integration**
   - Update TestSprite configuration to use the correct port
   - Fix expected responses in test scripts
   - Add more comprehensive MFA tests

2. **Implement Additional MFA Features**
   - Add MFA setup endpoint to generate and register TOTP secrets
   - Implement backup codes for MFA recovery
   - Add MFA disable/enable functionality

3. **RBAC Implementation**
   - Apply role-based access control to protected endpoints
   - Implement role assignment and management
   - Add permission checks to sensitive operations

## Testing Instructions

To test the MFA implementation manually:

1. Start the server on port 9999:
   ```
   python run_noxsuite_server.py --port 9999 --no-reload
   ```

2. Run the manual MFA verification script:
   ```
   python manual_mfa_verify.py
   ```

3. For automated testing, update the TestSprite configuration to use port 9999 and run:
   ```
   python testsprite_e2e.py --mfa
   ```

## Conclusion

The MFA implementation is now functional for basic verification, allowing users with MFA enabled to authenticate using TOTP codes. Additional work is needed for the setup process and TestSprite integration, but the core functionality is working as expected.
