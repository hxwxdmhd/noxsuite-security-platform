## 🎯 Next Steps Recommended

### Immediate Actions
1. **Test Core Functionality**: Run `python app.py` to start the server
2. **Review Archive**: Check archived files before permanent deletion
3. **Environment Setup**: Update `.env` with production credentials
4. **Frontend Setup**: Run `cd frontend && npm install && npm start`

### Development Workflow
1. **Use Installer**: Always run `python install.py` for new environments
2. **System Validation**: Run `python validate_system.py` after changes
3. **Clean Development**: Follow the streamlined structure
4. **Documentation**: Refer to generated reports for guidance

### Production Readiness
1. **Security Review**: Address flagged security issues
2. **Performance Testing**: Validate system under load
3. **Deployment**: Use cleaned Docker configurations
4. **Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive logging
