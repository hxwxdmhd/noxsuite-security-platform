  - [ ] Penetration testing validation

- [ ] **Cryptographic Audit Trails**
  - [ ] Immutable log storage system
  - [ ] Cryptographic proof mechanisms
  - [ ] Compliance verification automation
  - [ ] Audit trail integrity validation

### Phase 2: AI & Intelligence (Weeks 3-6)
- [ ] **AI Model Orchestration**
  - [ ] Multi-model routing engine
  - [ ] Context-aware task distribution
  - [ ] Performance optimization algorithms
  - [ ] Model selection automation

- [ ] **Predictive Diagnostics**

  - [ ] Plugin generator CLI
  - [ ] Validation framework
  - [ ] Community repository
  - [ ] Documentation system

## Gate 6 Success Criteria
- [ ] Security Score: 105/100 (Advanced)
- [ ] RLVR Compliance: 96%+
- [ ] Multi-Tenant Capability: OPERATIONAL
- [ ] Cloud-Native Support: ACTIVE
- [ ] AI Orchestration: INTELLIGENT
- [ ] Predictive Analytics: PROACTIVE
- [ ] Audit Trail Integrity: CRYPTOGRAPHIC

## Risk Assessment
- **LOW RISK**: Foundation components well-established
- **MEDIUM RISK**: Multi-tenant complexity requires careful testing
- **HIGH RISK**: Cloud-native integration needs comprehensive validation

## Mitigation Strategies
- Phased rollout with rollback capabilities
- Comprehensive testing at each phase
- Continuous monitoring and validation
- Community feedback integration
- Security-first approach throughout

## Next Actions
1. Begin Advanced Security Hardening
2. Implement Cryptographic Audit Trails
3. Develop AI Model Orchestration
4. Plan Multi-Tenant Architecture
5. Design Cloud-Native Interface
