## 🔧 OPERATIONAL SYSTEMS

### 🛡️ Legacy Prevention Watchdog
```bash
# Monitor for legacy re-entry
python scripts/watch_legacy_reentry.py

# Continuous monitoring
python scripts/watch_legacy_reentry.py --monitor

# Generate monitoring report
python scripts/watch_legacy_reentry.py --report
```

**Monitored Patterns:**
- ✅ `*.rlvr_backup` files
- ✅ Versioned legacy files (`*_v[0-9]*.py`)
- ✅ Backup files (`*.old`, `*.bak`)
- ✅ Known deprecated modules

### 🔗 Archive Verification System
```bash
# Verify archive integrity
python verify_archive_linkage.py verify

# Generate archive report
python verify_archive_linkage.py report

# Locate archived files
python verify_archive_linkage.py locate <filename>
```

**Archive Status:**
- ✅ 129 files verified accessible
- ✅ 2.01 MB total archive size
- ✅ External path confirmed operational
- ✅ Recovery procedures validated
