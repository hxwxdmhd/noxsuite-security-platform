test_smoke.py - RLVR Enhanced Component

REASONING: Comprehensive testing with Chain-of-Thought validation methodology

Chain-of-Thought Implementation:
1. Problem Analysis: Need systematic validation of component functionality
2. Solution Design: RLVR-compliant testing framework with reasoning validation
3. Logic Validation: Chain-of-Thought reasoning with evidence backing
4. Evidence Backing: Systematic validation, compliance monitoring, automated testing

Compliance: RLVR Methodology v4.0+ Applied
"""

Smoke tests for NoxPanel backend functionality.

These are quick tests designed to run in under 30 seconds
and validate basic system functionality.
