## Overview
This document describes how the NoxPanel Suite's multi-agent collaboration system is implemented and integrated within Visual Studio Code.

---

## 1. Workspace Configuration
- **Multi-root workspace**: Supports multiple project folders (core, AI, plugins, devops)
- **Docker integration**: `.vscode/settings.json` and Docker Compose files ensure remote container development
- **Language support**: Python, TypeScript, PHP (IntelliSense, linting, formatting)

## 2. Agent Integration
- **Supermaven (VS Code agent)**:
  - Activated via VS Code extension
  - Handles local code completion, refactoring, documentation, and syntax fixes
  - Reads/writes to `agents/project_context.json` and `agents/supaermaven_tasks.json`
  - Prompts and suggestions injected as comments in code files
- **Langflow (Orchestrator)**:
  - Triggered via Python scripts or REST API
  - Coordinates multi-step tasks, plugin integration, and dashboard updates
  - Reads/writes to `agents/project_context.json`, `agents/langflow_config.json`
  - Can be launched from VS Code terminal or tasks

## 3. Shared Context Pool
- All agents access the `agents/` folder for context, task queues, and configuration
- ContextManager and TaskCoordinator modules sync state between agents
- Real-time updates reflected in dashboard and status files

## 4. Agent Switching & Task Assignment
- `agents/agent_switch.json` defines agent specialties and current task ownership
- Agents dynamically claim or hand off tasks based on complexity and type
- Protocol ensures seamless collaboration and context sync

## 5. Monitoring & Feedback
- Performance dashboard (`http://localhost:5000`) displays agent metrics and status
- All agent actions logged in `agent_collaboration.log`
- Status and progress tracked in `agent_collaboration_status.json` and `agent_task_progress.json`

## 6. Extensibility
- Add new agents or LLMs by updating config/status files
- Integrate additional VS Code extensions for enhanced agent abilities
- Extend dashboard for deeper analytics and agent feedback

## Quick Start
1. Open VS Code in the project workspace
2. Ensure Docker containers are running (via Compose)
3. Activate Supermaven extension for local agent tasks
4. Launch Langflow orchestrator from terminal or Python script
5. Monitor collaboration and context sync via dashboard and status files

---

**All agents are now fully integrated and operational within Visual Studio Code.**
