   - Prompt injection protection
   - Model output sanitization
   - Secure model communication

5. **Data Protection**
   - Encrypted sensitive data storage
   - Secure configuration handling
   - Privacy-first design

### **Ongoing Security Practices**

- **Regular Security Audits**: Quarterly automated and manual reviews
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated vulnerability scanning for all dependencies
- **Code Review**: All changes reviewed for security implications
- **Penetration Testing**: Annual third-party security assessments

## Known Security Considerations

### **Voice Interface**
- Voice commands are processed locally by default
- Optional cloud AI models require explicit user consent
- Audio data is not stored or transmitted unless explicitly configured

### **AI Integration**
- Local AI models preferred for sensitive operations
- Network queries use sanitized data
- Model responses are validated before execution

### **Web Interface**
- HTTPS enforced in production
- CSRF protection enabled
- Secure cookie configuration

### **Configuration Files**
- Sensitive data encrypted at rest
- File permissions properly restricted
- Backup encryption recommended

## Security Best Practices for Users

### **Installation Security**

1. **Download Verification**
   ```bash
   # Verify GPG signature (when available)
   gpg --verify heimnetz-2.0.0.tar.gz.sig
   
   # Check SHA256 hash
   sha256sum -c heimnetz-2.0.0.tar.gz.sha256
   ```

2. **Secure Installation**
   ```bash
   # Use virtual environment
   python -m venv heimnetz-env
   source heimnetz-env/bin/activate
   
   # Install from official sources only
   pip install heimnetz
   ```

### **Configuration Security**

1. **Strong Authentication**
   - Use complex passwords
   - Enable two-factor authentication
   - Regularly rotate API keys

2. **Network Security**
   - Run on private networks when possible
   - Use firewall rules to restrict access
   - Enable HTTPS for web interface

3. **Regular Updates**
   ```bash
   # Check for updates regularly
   pip list --outdated
   pip install --upgrade heimnetz
   ```

### **Operational Security**

1. **Log Monitoring**
   - Review security logs regularly
   - Set up alerts for suspicious activity
   - Backup logs securely

2. **Access Control**
   - Limit administrative access
   - Use principle of least privilege
   - Regular access reviews

3. **Backup Security**
   - Encrypt configuration backups
   - Test restore procedures
   - Store backups securely

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

### **Coordinated Disclosure**

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. **Private Reporting**: Security issues reported privately first
2. **Fix Development**: We work on fixes before public disclosure
3. **Coordinated Timeline**: Disclosure timing coordinated with reporter
4. **Public Disclosure**: After fixes are available and deployed

### **Timeline Guidelines**

- **High severity**: 30 days
- **Medium/Low severity**: 60-90 days
- **Extensions available** for complex issues

### **Public Disclosure**

After fixes are deployed:
- Security advisory published
- CVE assigned if applicable
- Fix details and mitigation steps provided
- Credit given to reporter (unless anonymous requested)
