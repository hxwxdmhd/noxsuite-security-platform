- **Plugin Compatibility**: All plugin systems working together

## IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

1. **Execute Deployment**:
   ```powershell
   .\deploy_week1.ps1
   ```

2. **Launch Unified Server**:
   ```bash
   python launch_unified_server.py
   ```

3. **Access Dashboard**:
   - URL: http://localhost:5000
   - WebSocket: ws://localhost:5000/socket.io/

4. **Monitor System**:
   ```bash
   python system_monitor.py
   ```

5. **Verify Performance**:
   - Check system metrics endpoint: `/api/v1/metrics`
   - Monitor plugin status: `/api/v1/plugins`
   - Validate health check: `/api/v1/health`

## WEEK 2 PREPARATION

### Frontend Integration Ready
- **Target**: 0% → 100% frontend integration
- **Method**: Using frontend_backend_linkmap.json
- **Timeline**: Days 8-14
- **Expected**: Complete UI/API integration

### System Validation
- **Load Testing**: Multi-user concurrent access
- **Security Testing**: Authentication and authorization
- **Plugin Testing**: All plugin systems working
- **Performance Testing**: Measure 90% improvement
